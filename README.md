# bahai-reflib-data

This project aims to host information on the official Bahá'í Reference Library
website, in particular its unique identifiers, and host scripts for obtaining
and processing those IDs, such as to map them to paragraph number.

***Note that this is a work in progress. Currently only hosts data for
the Rashḥ-i-‘Amá, though we can gather the IDs by adding (or crawling for)
more titles with their URL metadata.***
